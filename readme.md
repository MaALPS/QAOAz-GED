# QAOA-Based Algorithms for Graph Optimization

This project implements three quantum-inspired algorithms based on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving graph optimization problems such as Graph Edit Distance (GED). The codebase is structured to support data generation, algorithm execution, meta-learning-based initialization, and visualization for academic use.

##  Directory Structure

### `dataset/`
This folder contains synthetic graph datasets automatically generated by `graphcreator.py`.  
Each `.pkl` file includes a pair of graphs:
- **Original Graph**
- **Target Graph**

These pairs are used as inputs for graph comparison and optimization tasks.

### `draw/`
Contains visualizations used for figures in the paper, such as algorithm diagrams and result plots.

### `Parameter/`
Includes meta-learned model trained to predict the initial parameters for QAOA.  
The model help accelerate convergence and improve performance during optimization.

##  Algorithm Implementations

The following scripts implement the three algorithms discussed in the paper:

- `QAOA.py`: Standard QAOA algorithm.
- `QAOAz.py`: An enhanced version of QAOA with ring mixers and improvements.
- `QAOA-GED-meta.py`: We proposed QAOAz-GED tailored for Graph Edit Distance tasks.

##  Output Results

- `output_qaoa.txt`: Contains results from `QAOA.py`.
- `output_qaoaz3.txt`: Contains results from `QAOAz.py`.
- `output_qaoaz2.txt`: Contains results from `QAOA-GED-meta.py`.

Each file logs the performance and key outputs from the corresponding algorithm runs.
